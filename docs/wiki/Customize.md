# Customize

The design lives in Molino's own components and style sheets. Selldone's commerce logic underneath stays untouched.

## Colours, type and spacing

- **Tokens:** `style/kalio-tokens.scss` holds the brand green (`--k-green`, `--k-green-deep`, `--k-green-lift`), the coral used for savings, ink, the stone "well" behind photos, radii and shadows.
- **Vuetify's primary colour** is set to the brand green in the same file (`--v-theme-primary`, `--v-theme-secondary`), so Selldone's own parts (gift cards, addresses, the payment window) don't show the theme's purple.
- **Typefaces:** Fraunces for headings and DM Sans for text, loaded in `components/kalio/kalio-fonts.ts` (from the app, not `index.html`).

Change the tokens and the whole site follows: buttons, badges, the compare badge, checkout and account.

[`KALIO.md`](https://github.com/selldone-custom-layouts/official-dino/blob/main/KALIO.md) explains every part, the reason behind each decision, and each workaround.

## Rules that keep it working

- **Re-skin, don't replace.** Keep Selldone's scripts for the basket, bill, checkout, variants, vendor offers and orders; change templates and styles.
- **Prefix every class** (`k-…`). Short names collide with Selldone's.
- **Live data only.** Never hard-code product names, prices, categories or URLs.
- **Vuetify draws icons as `<i>`.** Style decorative icons with `> i`, or you will move the icon inside them.
- **Sticky needs `overflow: clip`.** `.v-application` has `overflow: hidden`.
- **Android search:** `v-model` waits for the keyboard's composition to end. Use `:value` with `@input` for live search.
- **Never commit inside `modules/*`.** Keep a fix there as a patch in `patches/`.

## Two account designs

- `desk`: a side rail with order cards. This is the default for releases.
- `home`: tabs with an overview.

Pick at build time: `bash scripts/release.sh <version> desk` or `… home`.

## Test before you release

- Check the phone first: 360 and 390 px wide. Then tablet (768, 1024), laptop (1366, 1440) and desktop (1920).
- Walk through as a shopper: add products from cards and rows, add and save an address on the map, fill the checkout up to Pay, and tour the account.
- Look for:
  - overlapping or clipped text;
  - off-centre icons;
  - empty boxes;
  - anything hidden under a fixed bar;
  - Selldone's default look showing through.
